## Exercises

\textbf{4.2} There are two events $A$ and $B$. $P(A) = .5$ and $P(B) = .3$. The events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{Find} $\mathbf{P(\tilde{A})}$

$$
P(\tilde{A}) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
$$

\item \textbf{Find} $\mathbf{P(A \cap B)}$

$$
\begin{align}
P(A \cap B) = P(B | A) * P(A) \\
= P(B) * P(A)\ \ \  \text{(since A and B are independent)} \\
= .3 * .5 = .15
\end{align}
$$

\item \textbf{Find} $\mathbf{P(A \cup B)}$

$$
\begin{align}
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \\
= .5 + .3 - .15 = .65
\end{align}
$$

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4.4} There are two events $A$ and $B$. $P(A) = .7$ and $P(B) = .8$. $P(\tilde{A} \cap \tilde{B}) = .1$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{Are $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ independent events? Explain why or why not.}

$$
\begin{align}
P(A \cup B) = 1 - P(\overline{A \cup B}) \\ 
= 1 - P(\tilde{A} \cap \tilde{B})\ \ \text{ (using De Morgan's Law)} \\
= 1 - 0.1 = .9\\
\\

P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) \\
= .7 + .8 - .9 = .6 \\
\\

P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{.6}{.7} = \frac{6}{7} \neq \frac{4}{5} = P(B) \\
\therefore \text{A and B are not independent events}
\end{align}
$$

\item \textbf{Find} $\mathbf{P(A \cup B)}$

Refer to the first equation above. $P(A \cup B) = 0.9$.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4.6} Two fair dice, one red and one green, are rolled. Let the event $A$ be "the sum of the faces showing is equal to seven." Let the event B be "the faces showing on the two dice are equal."

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{List out the sample space of the experiment.}

$\Omega = \{ 2, 3, \dots, 12\}$

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{A}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(A)}$.

$A = \{ () \}$

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{B}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(B)}$.

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{A \cap B}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(A \cap B)}$.

\item \textbf{Are the events} $\mathbf{A}$ \textbf{and} $\mathbf{B}$ \textbf{independent? Explain why or why not.}

\item \textbf{How would you describe the relationship between event} $\mathbf{A}$ \textbf{and event} $\mathbf{B}$\textbf{?}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4.8} Two dice are rolled. The red die has been loaded. Its probabilities are $P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = \frac{1}{5}$ and $P(5) = P(6) = \frac{1}{10}$. The green die is fair. Let the event $A$ be "the sum of the faces showing is an even number." Let the event B be "the sum of the faces showing is divisible by 3."

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{A}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(A)}$.

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{B}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(B)}$.

\item \textbf{List the outcomes in } $\mathbf{A \cap B}$, \textbf{and find} $\mathbf{P(A \cap B)}$.

\item \textbf{Are the events} $\mathbf{A}$ \textbf{and} $\mathbf{B}$ \textbf{independent? Explain why or why not.}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4.10} Suppose there is a medical screening procedure for a specific cancer that has \textit{sensitivity} = .90, and \textit{specificity} = .95. Suppose the underlying rate of the cancer in the population is .001. Let $B$ be the event "the person has that specific cancer," and let $A$ be the event "the screening procedure gives a positive result."

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item \textbf{What is the probability that a person has the disease given the results of the screening is positive?}

\item \textbf{Does this show that screening is effective in detecting this cancer?}

\end{enumerate}
